\item Recompiled Tikzit and integrated TinyTeX for EPS/LaTeX support
\item Began user story collection

\end{itemize} 
Due October 16th \newline
Goal: Software prerequisites up and running

\noindent \textbf{Phase 3 – Implementation}

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Build core drag-and-drop UML editor
\item Enable EPS/PNG/JPEG export
\item Add GitHub sync and collaboration features

\end{itemize} 
Due November 30th \newline
Goal: Working prototype (with all musts implemented)

\vspace{10}
\noindent \textbf{Phase 4 – Testing & Refinement}

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Validate requirements coverage with use cases

\item Optimize performance for cross-platform use

\end{itemize} 
Due Date To Be Determined \newline
Goal: Finished, working code

\vspace{20}



\noindent \textbf{The timeline is subject to change due to outside factors and is tentative}


\section{IRB Protocol}
There is no IRB protocol necessary for this project, as this project is strictly based on software. 


\section{Agile Method}

\textbf{Iterative Process} - Work divided into weekly reports, each producing tangible progress

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]

\item We plan on having weekly meeting and iterative workloads

\end{itemize} 

\vspace{10}

\noindent \textbf{User Centered} - Requirements captured as user stories to guide development
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]

\item Requirements are based around user stories 


\end{itemize} 



\vspace{10}
\noindent \textbf{Collaboration} - Team of 3 shares tasks via Overleaf and GitHub, ensuring transparency

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Weekly meetings will go over everyone's tasks


\end{itemize} 


\vspace{10}
\noindent \textbf{Flexibility} – Adjust scope and priorities based on weekly findings and challenges

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Some things will be adjusted as time goes on, with some things being decided on later to avoid ballooning costs


\end{itemize} 

\vspace{10}
\noindent \textbf{Continuous Improvement} - Each sprint includes documentation updates, and bug fixes,before moving forward

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Our weekly reports will emphasize what was done and needs to be done to encourage continuous improvement

\end{itemize} 


\section{Method}
The information below will be about our project.

\subsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]

\item C++ with help of TinyTex being R or Powershell. Python for creating automation scripts.
\item Mac OS and Windows as operating systems (possibly Linux but not fully looked into)
\item TikZiT and Tinytex for GUI and TikZ as the package (more added in the future)
\item Laptop/PC (Software Only)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Review Process}
Review Process to be determined throughout the project.

\subsection{Build Plan}
Currently using code from two tools listed above. Compiled separately from their GitHub pages, but will work on combining into one compilation to get both the GUI and compiler.

\subsection{Workspace}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]

\item Laptops or Desktops used for working on the code (we have both a Windows and Mac operating system  to test both operating systems)
\item Software engineering lab for work space, but some work will be virtual.
\item GitHub for all the code. Jira for Kanban Boards and task tracking. VS Code mainly used for actually modifying the code

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modification Request Process}
Will be using Jira and GitHub for requesting and showing any problems that we find and add priorities to the issues. Along the project, we’ll be adding any new ideas that we want in our project using Jira and GitHub.

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]

\item GitHub: used for code issues
\item Jira: Anything else that we need to work on in the  project

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]

\item UML Creators
\item Software Engineering Students/Professors
\item Software Businesses
\item Original creators of the Tikzit
\item Original creators of the Tiny Text
\item Open source software people

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Plan}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]

\item Communication between team members with the use of SMS or emails
\item Use of Email for stakeholders.
\item No current regime of communications  between stakeholders (no planned dates or time for communication)

\end{itemize}
