\textbf{UML Creators}& 
Those who need to create a uml diagram
& They are going to be a large user base, and are the biggest scope of users for this project (essentially, a catch-all for everyone who might use the product)\\
\hline
\textbf{Software Engineering students/Professors }& 
Those who are learning how to make uml or teaching it
& These people are mostly affected by the intuitive design and the functionality, with less emphasis on cost\\
\hline
\textbf{Software Businesses}& 
Those who are in charge of making large, complex programs that are used commercially and require specific and demanding code.
& These people are mostly affected by cost and functionality, with less emphasis on having an intuitive design.\\
\hline
\textbf{Original creators of Tikzit}& 
The group who made the original Tikzit, the basis for this project
& These people are affected by what we do with their code, and must be credited.\\
\hline
\textbf{Original creators of Tiny Text}& 
The group who made the original Tiny text, a useful tool for this project
& These people are affected by what we do with their code, and must be credited.\\
\hline
\textbf{Open source software people}& 
Those who rely almost solely on open source code, and who might be relying on this product by itself.
& These people care about intuitive design and functionality, similar to students and professors. \\
\hline
\textbf{Competitor UML diagram makers}& 
Those who work on or represent other UML making software (visual paradigm, draw.io, and others)
& These will influence us, as well as potentially be influenced BY us, and affect how many users we will have directly. \\
